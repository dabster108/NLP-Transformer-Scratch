In 2025, AI systems like GPT-5, BERT, and DALL·E are revolutionizing industries; however, not all applications are flawless! Consider self-driving cars: Tesla's Autopilot, Waymo, and Cruise have logged millions of miles, yet accidents still occur. Why? Sensor errors, unexpected obstacles, and software bugs. 

Meanwhile, social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok) struggle with content moderation: hate speech, spam, fake news—these challenges persist despite advanced algorithms. Users report issues at a rate of 23% per month, which is alarming. 

On the personal side, I bought a smartwatch for $299.99—promised heart-rate tracking, sleep monitoring, and step counting. Pros: sleek design, intuitive interface. Cons: battery dies in 6 hours; sometimes notifications lag; syncing issues with Android phones. Frustrating!

Finally, consider natural disasters: floods, hurricanes, wildfires… climate change worsens the frequency & intensity. Scientists predict a 35% increase in extreme weather events by 2030. Governments and NGOs scramble to respond, but data collection & modeling remain inconsistent.
